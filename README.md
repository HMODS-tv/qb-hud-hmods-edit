# qb-hud-hmods-edit
**Hey there this is my first release for a FiveM script.**

+ **This is strictly a rework of the main HUD that is already out there!** [qb-hud](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-hud)


+ **To open the menu in-game the default key is "I" or you can type "/menu"**

+ **Your settings will always be stored locally, so even if you delete the resource it will keep your current settings. The only way you can wipe the local storage sucessfully is by clicking the "Reset Settings" button on the in-game menu**

+ **If you want the new super snazzy sound effects for the menu, you'll need to download the latest update of interact-sound
(comes with new open menu sound, close menu sound, click menu sound)**

+ **If you receive attempt to index a nil value (global 'Lang') in your F8 console, the fastest way you can fix that issue is by downloading a new version via txAdminRecipe but if you are unable to do that because of the progress you’ve made on your existing build; you’ll have to unfortunately go through and download each one from the GitHub which I do not recommend. Save yourself a lot of time and pain by just downloading the recipe!**
